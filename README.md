## Hi there!

I am a master's student in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at [University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) (graduating May 2026), with a strong interest in applying AI, spatial data, and machine learning to solve pressing social and policy challenges.


🔭 What I’m Working On

- 🔭 Building a Python package for spatial joining and analysis of satellite imagery, focused on climate-related variables
- 🌱 Collaborating on big data visualizations that support impactful storytelling in climate change impacts on child development
- 💡 Exploring the intersection of AI, human development, and data accessibility to improve decision-making in underserved communities
- 🤓 I also teach spatial analysis in Python at [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/)

⚡ Let’s Connect

Always happy to collaborate on projects at the intersection of data, AI, policy, and impact.
